CIPHERX RAB
Caesar Cipher Tool

This is a simple yet functional Caesar Cipher tool written in Python, designed for both encryption and decryption of messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.

Features

Encryption and Decryption: Easily encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher method by specifying a shift value.
Invisible Input: Utilizes getpass to make message and shift value inputs invisible for added security.
Editable Input: Allows users to view and optionally edit the message and shift value before performing encryption or decryption.
User-Friendly Interface: Prompts for user actions and provides feedback on input choices to ensure a smooth experience.

How It Works

1.Action Selection: Choose whether to encrypt, decrypt, or quit.
2.Message Input: Enter the message for encryption or decryption using getpass to keep it hidden.
3.Message Review: Optionally view and edit the message before processing.
4.Shift Value Input: Enter the shift value (hidden input) and review or edit it if needed.
5.Processing: The program performs the Caesar Cipher encryption or decryption based on the userâ€™s choice.
6.Output: Displays the result of the encryption or decryption.

Usage

To use the tool, simply run the script, follow the prompts to enter your message and shift value, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the message.
